# Game of Life

Following along with the [Rust and WebAssembly book][book].

See init.zsh for a record of what I've done so far.  From the book:

> Anytime you make changes and want them reflected on http://localhost:8080/,
> just re-run the wasm-pack build command within the wasm-game-of-life
> directory.

Rebuilding the Rust code this way automatically hot-reloads the page.
